Assignment: Intelligent CV Analyzer using String Matching Algorithms 
Title: Design and Implementation of a CV Analyzer using String Matching Algorithms for Automated 
Skill Extraction and Job Fit Evaluation 
Problem Statement: 
Recruiters and HR departments often receive hundreds of CVs for a single job opening. Manually 
reviewing these CVs to identify qualified candidates is time-consuming and error prone. Most CVs 
contain unstructured text, making it difficult to automatically identify relevant skills, qualifications, and 
experience. 
The challenge is to develop an intelligent CV Analyzer that uses string matching and pattern matching 
algorithms to automatically extract key information from resumes and compare it against predefined 
job requirements. 
This project aims to explore the use of Brute Force, Rabin–Karp, and Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) 
algorithms for efficient keyword and pattern matching in large collections of CV text. The system 
should identify whether a candidate’s profile matches a given job description based on the presence 
(or absence) of required skills and qualifications. 
Objectives: 
To implement and compare classical string-matching algorithms (Brute Force, Rabin–Karp, KMP) for 
text analysis. 
To develop a program that can automatically: 
▪ Extract and match skills, tools, and technologies from CVs. 
▪ Compare them with job description keywords. 
▪ To analyze the efficiency and accuracy of each algorithm on large text datasets (multiple CVs). 
▪ To recommend the most effective algorithm for real-time CV screening. 
Case Study Scenario: 
You are part of a recruitment software development team building a CV Screening Tool for a hiring 
agency. The system must process hundreds of text-based resumes daily and rank candidates based 
on keyword relevance to job postings. 
Each job description includes a list of mandatory and optional keywords (e.g., “Python”, “Machine 
Learning”, “SQL”, “Data Analysis”). 
The system should: 
▪ Read a candidate’s CV (plain text or extracted text from PDF or Docx). 
▪ Use string matching algorithms to detect occurrences of these keywords. 
▪ Compute a relevance score based on matches. 
▪ Output a ranked list of candidates by match percentage. 
Project Tasks: 
Algorithm Implementation: 
▪ Implement Brute Force, Rabin–Karp, and KMP algorithms for pattern searching. 
Each algorithm should: 
▪ Identify all occurrences of a keyword in the CV text. 
▪ Support multiple pattern searches (list of keywords). 
▪ Handle both case-sensitive and case-insensitive matches. 
Dataset: 
▪ CVs are provided (pdf and docx) 
▪ Create 3 job descriptions with defined skill requirements (e.g., Data Scientist, Web Developer, 
Software Tester). 
Functionality Implementation: 
Input: CV text and job description keywords. 
Output: 
▪ List of matched and missing keywords. 
▪ Relevance score (e.g., percentage of skills matched). 
▪ Performance metrics (execution time, comparisons). 
Performance Analysis: 
Compare the efficiency of the three algorithms on: 
▪ Small vs large CV files. 
▪ Single keyword vs multiple keyword searches. 
▪ Record execution time and number of character comparisons. 
▪ Present findings using charts or tables. 
Reporting: 
Include: 
▪ Algorithm explanation and pseudocode. 
▪ Flowchart of your CV Analyzer system. 
▪ Comparative analysis of results. 
▪ Discussion on trade-offs (speed, accuracy, collisions, preprocessing). 
▪ Recommendation of the best algorithm for practical use. 
Expected Deliverables: 
▪ It must be a desktop or web application: Source code (Python/C++/Java/.net/android, any 
language, tool can be used) 
▪ CV and job description text files (datasets is already provided not to be uploaded again, job 
description must be uploaded) 
▪ Output reports showing matches and scores 
▪ Performance results (tables/graphs)
